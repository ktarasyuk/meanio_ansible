[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-oss.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-oss)

This role installs NGINX OSS on your target host. It supports most CentOS/RHEL/Debian/Ubuntu/SLES distributions.

Requirements
------------

This role was developed using Ansible 2.3.1.0. Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

Use `ansible-galaxy install nginxinc.nginx-oss` to install the role on your system.

The following platforms have been tested and are oficially supported:

    CentOS:
      versions:
        - 6
        - 7
    RedHat:
      versions:
        - 6
        - 7
    Debian:

Example Playbook
----------------

This is a sample playbook file for deploying the Ansible Galaxy NGINX OSS role in a localhost.

    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      become: true
      roles:
        - role: nginxinc.nginx-oss

This is a sample playbook file for deploying the Ansible Galaxy NGINX OSS role to a dynamic inventory containing the `nginx` tag.

    ---
    - hosts: tag_nginx
      remote_user: root
      become: true
      roles:
        - role: nginxinc.nginx-oss

To run any of the above sample playbooks create a `setup-nginx.yml` file and paste the contents. Executing the Ansible Playbook is then as simple as executing `ansible-playbook ./setup-nginx.yml`.

Alternatively, you can also clone this repository instead of installing it from Ansible Galaxy. If you decide to do so, replace the role variable in the previous sample playbooks from `nginxinc.nginx-oss` to `ansible-role-nginx-oss`.
